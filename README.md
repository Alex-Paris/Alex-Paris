## Sup Bro 👊

My name is Alex Paris and I'm a Systems Development Manager 🤴  
But this doesn't matter in here. In fact, I'm more like a student 👨‍🎓  
Sometimes like a teacher 👨‍🏫  
Sometimes even like a detective 🕵️‍♂️ trying to discover your bug's 🐱‍👤  
But this doesn't really matter cause we're friend's. Right!? _("Why can we be friends .. !?" 🎵)_  

### About:
- 👀 I’m interested in Full-Stack development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS, React Native and Node.js
- 👻 I am a Dev Ghost!!
